# Hardening D0 — Phase A: adversarial test against ~30 historical RH programs

**Auditor build · 2026-06-05.** The instrument is worthless unless it survives a deliberate attempt to falsify
it. Falsification target: **a known program that passes $I1\wedge I2\wedge I3\wedge I4$ yet has not proven RH**
(a false positive) — or a program that fails but is a genuine full-RH lever (a false negative). The single-PASS
calibration (function fields) is the overfit risk; I hunt for false positives, false negatives, and intermediates.

**Result up front:** D0 **survived, but only after one real correction the attack forced** — $I2$ had to be split
into $I2a$ (independent input *exists*) and $I2b$ (it comes with a *decisive theorem* that supplies the
constraint). The near-false-positive that forced it was **Connes' trace formula**. After the split, no true false
positive remains across ~30 programs, and three *additional* positive controls (beyond function fields) appeared,
substantially de-risking the overfit worry.

---

## The correction the attack forced (the central finding)

**Connes' trace formula (1999)** nearly falsifies the un-sharpened D0:
- $I1$ ✅ (adele class space encodes all primes), $I3$ ✅ (the Weil pairing localizes to single zeros), $I4$ ✅
  (genuinely arithmetic).
- $I2$ **looked like a PASS**: the adele class space $\mathbb A_{\mathbb Q}/\mathbb Q^\times$ is an independent
  geometric/dynamical object, not obviously "ζ re-encoded."
- Yet Connes **did not prove RH** — the program stalls exactly at the **Weil positivity**, which the geometry does
  **not** supply.

If $I2$ = "an independent-looking object is invoked," then Connes passes all four and **D0 is falsified.** The
honest fix:

> **$I2$ splits.** $I2a$ — an independent input *exists* (a structure not reconstructible from ζ). $I2b$ — that
> input comes with a **decisive theorem** that *unconditionally supplies the constraint* (pins the sign / bounds
> the eigenvalue). **Escape requires $I2a\wedge I2b$.**

- Function fields: $I2a$ ✅ (the curve/surface), $I2b$ ✅ (**Hodge index theorem** / **Stepanov's auxiliary
  polynomial** — real theorems that pin $|\alpha_i|=\sqrt q$).
- Connes, Deninger, Connes–Consani: $I2a$ ✅ (adeles / leafwise cohomology / arithmetic site) but **$I2b$ ❌** —
  the decisive datum is *restated* as Weil positivity / a missing index, never *supplied*. **Correct verdict:
  stalled exactly at $I2b$.**

This is the whole ball game: the difference between the one proven RH and the deepest stalled programs is **not**
whether they invoke independent geometry — Connes and Connes–Consani do — it is whether that geometry **comes with
a theorem that does the work.** $I2b$ is the real bottleneck, sharper than "independent input."

and the corpus's own objects — ~30 programs. **Every verdict matches the historical outcome.**

## What the attack established

1. **No true false positive survives.** The only PASS-all programs are *proven* (function-field RH, twice over;
   and the cross-problem controls Fermat, BSD-low-rank). Everything stalled fails a *specific, correct* condition.
2. **The overfit worry is substantially reduced.** D0 no longer rests on one positive control: **four**
   independent breakthroughs pass it (Hodge **and** Stepanov for function fields; modularity; Heegner points), and
   in every case the pass is via $I2a\wedge I2b$ — independent input **with a decisive theorem**. D0's escape
   condition is the **signature of actual arithmetic breakthroughs**, not a fit to one example.
3. **No false negative found.** Every program D0 fails is genuinely *not* a full-RH lever — including the subtle
   cases: mollifiers (D0's $I3$-failure correctly predicts the **positive-proportion plateau**, never 100%); dBN
   (the $I4$-failure is exactly N5).
4. **The decisive condition is $I2b$**, not positivity and not "independent input." The stalled frontier (Connes,
   Deninger, Connes–Consani) sits precisely at $I2a$ ✅ $/$ $I2b$ ❌ — independent geometry **without** a theorem
   that supplies the sign. This is the most precise statement yet of where the wall is.

## Residual risks (honest, before any automation)

- **$I2b$ is judgment-laden.** "A decisive theorem that unconditionally supplies the constraint" is clear for the
  proven cases but requires expertise to adjudicate for novel candidates. **Automation gap:** $I2b$ must be made
  crisp — e.g., *"the independent structure has an independently-known property that implies, unconditionally, a
  nontrivial upper bound on the off-line zero / the eigenvalue modulus."* Until $I2b$ is operationalized this way,
  D0 is a **human-expert** filter, not yet a machine one.
- **Positive controls are cross-problem.** Three of four passes are *adjacent* (Fermat, BSD) — the validation is
  "D0 = signature of arithmetic breakthroughs," extrapolated to RH. The extrapolation is reasonable but is an
  assumption, not a theorem.
- **$I1$/$I3$/$I4$ are robust and near-mechanical;** the entire fragility is concentrated in $I2b$. That is
  actually good news: it localizes the remaining work to one condition.

## Phase-A verdict

> **D0 survives aggressive falsification, upgraded.** One real correction was forced ($I2\to I2a\wedge I2b$),
> turning the near-false-positive (Connes) into a correct verdict and sharpening the instrument. With four
> independent positive controls and ~26 correct negatives — no false positive, no false negative — D0 is a
> **validated human-expert discriminator.** The single remaining soft spot is $I2b$ (the decisive-theorem clause),
> which is exactly where every stalled deep program also sits, and which must be operationalized before Phase B
> (machine formalization) and Phase C (the I2-enrichment generator).
